## Description

Stacks 'n Stacks is a Ruby on Rails app that quickly lets readers browse quality books. We leverage the Goodreads API to collect lists of user-curated books, and then use the Google Books Viewer API to present previews of each book to users.

## Background

We all felt that finding books online should be as natural as wandering through a bookstore. There was no service out there that combined curated book lists with book previews, so we decided to make one! We also felt that it would be important to maintain a seamless reading experience for users, so we challenged ourselves by integrating a Javascript-powered one-page Bootstrap theme ([Magister](http://www.bootstrapzero.com/bootstrap-template/magister)). We use jQuery to change the sections of our site, and AJAX to make asynchronous calls to our server for views and data.

## Features

- Browse books with our integrated Google Books viewer
- Register for the site to save books that you liked

## Future

Currently working on:

1. Enhancing Saved Books page
2. Providing basic recommendations based on books users like
